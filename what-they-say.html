				<h3>Telstra Experience Centre</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>In 2009 Matt and Chris from The Squad tackled a difficult project for the Telstra Experience Centre - bringing to life a multi-dimensional facilitation tool with non-linear navigation functionality. The end product has been what we call "The Ecosystem" which provides us with an in-house facility to illustrate customer relationships and products, complete with a mind map functionality.</p>
					<p>I remain impressed with the flexibility of The Squad and their capacity to deliver what we ask for. The intellect and experience of The Squad team is deep and wide, with the smarts to make it happen no matter how complex the concept. The Squad remain a valuable resource for the Telstra Experience Centre.</p>

				<h3>Aussie Homeloans</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The Squad have been an extended part of the Aussie marketing team for many years now. They produce high quality work, often in ridiculously short timeframes.</p>
					
					<p>They have developed friendly, open and effective relationships with the Aussie marketing team members who work with them on a daily basis. The Squad is flexible, straight forward and very easy to work with.</p>

				<h3>The Travel Corporation</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The Squad has been invaluable in working with Uniworld Boutique River Cruising to launch our new Australian website. From the design to the content integration, the whole project went really smoothly – so well in fact, that both our New Zealand and South African teams had The Squad launch their own versions of the site. We have already passed on the guys’ details to other brands in The Travel Corporation portfolio.</p>

				<h3>Setanta Sports</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>We were immediately impressed with The Squad’s portfolio, their friendly, professional approach to customer service and their ability to meet often demanding deadlines. After working with them for the last few months across a number of campaigns, we have had fantastic results and continue to have a great working relationship with them. In a nutshell - I would highly recommend them.</p>

				<h3>CIEAM</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>I would like to formally and publicly applaud The Squad for the excellent service provided to the CRC for Integrated Engineering Asset Management over the past two years. Throughout the critical change of our corporate image and launch of our profile activities, the level of service and quality of work to our CRC exceeded our expectations. </p>
					
					<p>I am so impressed by the support and valuable service provided that I can confidently recommend The Squad to anyone. The high standards, professionalism and commitment The Squad hold, are reflected in our commercial portfolio and presentation. It has been a pleasure to work with the entire Squad team.</p>
